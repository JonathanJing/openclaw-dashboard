# Changelog

## [1.7.5] - 2026-03-04

### 🐛 Bug Fixes — Cost Calculation Overhaul

**Root cause 1: Orphan file scanning (alltime $184 bug)**
- `handleOpsAlltime` used `filter(f => f.includes('.jsonl'))` which matched `.jsonl.deleted.*` and `.jsonl.reset.*` backup files — historical session data counted multiple times
- Fixed: changed to `endsWith('.jsonl')` — only live session files scanned

**Root cause 2: Cron double-counting**
- Cron subagent sessions were counted in *both* session `.jsonl` files AND `cron/runs/*.jsonl` summaries
- Fixed: alltime now does one clean pass per source — session files for interactive sessions, cron/runs for completed cron sessions. No overlap.

**Root cause 3: `total_tokens` is unreliable in cron run records**
- In `cron/runs` finished records, `total_tokens` = cumulative context window size (grows with each turn), not actual tokens consumed per run. For Gemini Flash this could be 10–115× the real value.
- Fixed: cron run cost now uses `input_tokens + output_tokens` exclusively

**Root cause 4: Scan window too small for header stats**
- `scanSessionUsageToday` read only the last 500KB of each session file — high-volume sessions (Watchdog, jobs-intel) lost early-day messages
- Fixed: window increased to 25MB

**Root cause 5: Cache token pricing (10× overestimate)**
- `estimateCost` applied full input rate to `cacheRead`/`cacheWrite` tokens
- Fixed: per-model `cacheCosts` added to `models-registry.json`; correct rates applied (e.g. Sonnet cacheRead $0.30/1M vs $3.00/1M input)

### 🐛 Additional Fix — Opus Historical Data
- Opus (and other models from interactive sessions) was severely undercounted — `.reset` and `.deleted` session files that belonged to cron subagents were excluded (correct), but non-cron interactive sessions that were reset/deleted were also being excluded (wrong)
- Fixed: build a set of cron session UUIDs from `cron/runs/*.jsonl`; `.reset`/`.deleted` files are included if their UUID is NOT a known cron session
- Result: 85 additional archived interactive session files now correctly included in historical scan

### 📊 Verified Accuracy
- Mar 3 bar chart: **$75.97** (was $183.82 before fix)
- Finance/Cron tab: **$71.07**
- Delta ~7% — expected, two endpoints use slightly different session registries

## [1.7.4] - 2026-03-03

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Critical: JS SyntaxError that broke entire dashboard** — `renderAgentMonitor()` used `await` without being declared `async`; entire inline script silently failed to execute, causing "Connecting…" state with no data loaded
- **Critical: Duplicate `let` declarations** — `globalDefaultModel`, `MODEL_OPTIONS`, `refreshModelOptions`, `getDefaultModelLabel` were all declared twice (copy-paste artifact), causing `Identifier already declared` SyntaxError
- **`/ops/channels` returned HTTP 500** — `handleOpsChannels` referenced `parsed` from outer scope but the parameter was never passed; fixed function signature

### ✨ Features & Improvements

**Model Mix (top header card):**
- Local/Ollama models (e.g. `qwen3.5:35b-a3b`) now appear in Model Mix — previously invisible because they run as cron subagents, not channel sessions
- `cronModelMix` is now computed per-run (accurate model×token counts from `cron/runs/*.jsonl`) instead of per-job-label — eliminates model misattribution when a cron job uses mixed models
- Cloud models (Gemini, Sonnet) remain authoritative from sessions; cron-only models are merged without double-counting
- Model names and colors now correctly resolve for Anthropic models: `claude-sonnet-4-6` (hyphen) now matches pattern `sonnet-4.6` (dot) via normalized matching
- Model labels updated: "Claude Sonnet 4" → **"Claude Sonnet 4.6"**, "Claude Opus 4" → **"Claude Opus 4.6"**

**Sessions Panel:**
- **Dedup by channelId**: same Discord channel appearing under multiple session keys (e.g. `discord:channel:ID` vs `discord:direct:channel:ID` after key format change) is now merged into one row, with stats combined
- **"Hide Stale" toggle button** added to sessions panel — one click hides all stale (inactive) sessions, showing only active + idle channels; click again to show all

**Cron Job Model Labels:**
- Job model label now reflects the **most recent run's model** (JSONL appends newest last); previously stuck on first-ever run's model, causing jobs that migrated models to show stale labels

### 🔧 Technical
- Sessions cache keyed by query string (`?hideStale=1`, `?staleDays=N`) — filter variants no longer return stale cached results
- `cronModelMixByDay` accumulated inline during run-record iteration for O(1) per-run cost

## [1.7.3] - 2026-03-03
### Added
- Simplified installation instructions (Ask OpenClaw / CLI) to SKILL.md and README.md.

## [1.7.2] - 2026-03-03

### ✨ Features
- **Dynamic Model Registry**: Completely removed hardcoded models, display names, and costs from the Dashboard frontend (`agent-dashboard.html`) and backend (`api-server.js`).
- **Dynamic Pricing via `models-registry.json`**: Cost estimation logic (I/O) is now decoupled and driven entirely by `models-registry.json`. Updating prices (e.g., from Google/Anthropic pricing pages) or adding new models requires zero JS code changes.
- **Smart Color Theming**: Dashboard charts now automatically assign distinct colors to models based on their provider family (Google: Blues, Anthropic: Pinks/Reds, OpenAI: Greens, Local: Teals) using an intelligent palette hash algorithm, ensuring models never collide.


## [1.7.0] - 2026-03-01

### 🔒 Security (VirusTotal Review Round 2)
- **Removed hardcoded gateway restart token** from agent-dashboard.html; restart now proxied through authenticated `/ops/restart` API endpoint
- **Token no longer sent via URL query params** in API calls; switched to `Authorization: Bearer` header for all apiFetch requests
- **Token stripped from URL** immediately on page load via `history.replaceState` to prevent leakage in Referer/logs/history
- **Removed localStorage token storage** from server-monitor.html (was still present despite v1.6.0 claim)
- **Added DOMPurify** for all marked.js markdown rendering to prevent XSS via untrusted task content
- **Added `/ops/restart` server-side endpoint** that proxies to gateway hooks with env-sourced HOOK_TOKEN
- **Updated SECURITY.md** to accurately reflect auth flow, XSS mitigations, and restart architecture
